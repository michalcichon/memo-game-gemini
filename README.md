# 🧠 LLM Vibe-Coded Memory Game — Gemini Version

This repository contains the version of the **vibe-coded memory game** generated by **Gemini** as part of my experiment with large language models.

The purpose of this project was to test how effectively LLMs can build a simple but complete application with minimal human guidance.  
Here, Gemini was asked to implement a browser-based memory game purely from natural language instructions — without writing any code manually.
